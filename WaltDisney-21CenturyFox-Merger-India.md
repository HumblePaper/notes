## India theatre update to Walt Disney Comcast Battle

India saw a small blimp of the ongoing fireworks in one of the largest media takeover battles in global corporate history. On July 9, 2018, The Walt Disney Company (Disney) and a special purpose vehicle, TWDC HoldCo. (Holdco) filed a notice with the Competition Commission of India in connection with their proposed global takeover of Twenty-First Century Fox ("21CF"). 

The notice was filed pursuant to section 5 of the Competition Act, 2002 that regulates certain specific types of acquisitions or mergers based on the asset value of the acquiring, acquired or merged entities. The notice describes the transaction as involving the acquisition of 21CF, including its film and television studios, along with cable and international TV businesses by Disney and Holdco.

Disney is active in India through its acquisition, in  2012, of a controlling stake in Ronnie Screwvalla's UTV Software Communications Limited. Its operating entity, though, is Disney Entertainment (India) Limited, a company in which it last infused INR 467 Crores in July 2017.

Except that the acquisition isn't yet a done deal.
